# spin-up
Some ideas: full on native k8 app with ingress, domain and ssl cert. Web server gets requests, triggers another services which spins/builds VM (locally or on some cloud ventor). Implement metrics, logging, k8 patterns and so on. Tech to try out: Prometheus, Grafana, Packer, maybe some service mesh etc.
